# DicomData
This repository provides you with python code snippet on extracting metadata of Dicom MRI data including Magnetic field strength, study date and manufacturer.

For Metadata_dicom.py:
Please replace 'path_to_your_dicom_file.dcm' with the path to your DICOM file and 'output.txt' with the path where you want to save the text file. This script will write each DICOM element’s tag, VR (Value Representation), and value to the text file.

Remember to install the pydicom library if you haven’t already. You can do this by running pip install pydicom in your terminal.
